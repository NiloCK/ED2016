# Reflection - Drywall

## Johnny Bungay & Colin Kennedy

#### If doing the drywall/plastering project again what would you do differently?

Between us and the other drywall group, there wasn't enough material on hand to complete the project as prescribed. Taking a better account of the available materials before starting might have left Mike and Matt with more to work with.

#### What advantages are there to using drywall screws and screw guns instead of hammer and nails?

- The screw gun can be set at a certain depth, so that screws are all set appropriately.
- A bad hammer swing can damage the drywall. This doesn't happen with the screw gun.
- The screw gun is faster.

#### How could you have divided your duties differently to make the project be more effective?

In a larger project, it would be suitable to divide work with one member measuring, cutting, and hanging drywall while the other concentrates on plastering and sanding.

#### Discuss the advantages of working inside in a shop environment as opposed to outside on a typical jobsite. Give at least three advantages and disadvantages of each.

- Open, moving air at jobsite could result in less dust inhalation.
- Working in the shop gives better immediate access to feedback and peer instruction.
- The shop is low pressure, where the focus is on development & learning. Errors don't eat into a profit margin.
