# Electrical Reflections - Bench

## Johnny Bungay and Colin Kennedy

### 1. If doing the residential electrical wiring project again what would you do differently?

- Would do a better job collecting materials and tools before working. This is doable now because we know the materials better and can more accurately estimate our needs.
- Our knowledge of the connections has improved - eg, no exposed wire with marette connections. Further work will reflect this experience.

### 2. What are the advantages of wiring at the workbench as opposed to running the wires in an actual wall?
The workbench is easier to manipulate. EG, the bench can be turned over if that provides a better vantage for some piece of work. It is difficult to turn a wall upside down in the same situation.


### 3. How could you have divided your duties differently to make the project be more effective?
We worked well together. A possible improvement in terms of efficiency would be to specify one team member to do the electrical work while the other plans, collects tools and materials and provides them to the hands-on member. This could potentially reduce the amount of downtime and lead to quicker completion. Given that this is a learning exercise though, it's probably better to share duties so that each group member gets all the relevant experience.

### 4. Discuss the advantages of working inside in a shop as opposed to working on a typical jobsite. Give at least three advantages and disadvantages of each.

##### Shop :
Advantages:
 - Clean environment
 - Tools easily available
 - Easy collaboration with other students & instructor

 Disadvantages:
  - Some crowding - small space for many students
  - Lots of work in a confined area can be noisy
  - Less potential for large projects

##### Job Site

Advantages:
 - Better pay
 - Potential for a larger work area - less crowding
 - More autonomy

Disadvantages:
 - Further to go for tools and materials
 - Weather
 - Greater personal risk / responsibility
