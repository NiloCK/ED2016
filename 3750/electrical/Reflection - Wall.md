# Electrical Reflections - Bench

## Johnny Bungay and Colin Kennedy

### 1. If doing the residential electrical construction project again what would you do differently?

- Would do a better job collecting materials and tools before working. This is doable now because we know the materials better and can more accurately estimate our needs.
- Our knowledge of the connections has improved - eg, no exposed wire with marette connections. Further work will reflect this experience.

### 2. What are the advantages of wiring circuits in properly studded walls?
There is more room to work at the wall, and in the case of an unfinished interior wall, it is easily accessible from both sides.

The wall is also less prone to moving around - there is no need to brace it when applying a screw, for example.

### 3. How could you have divided your duties differently to make the project be more effective?
A possible improvement in terms of efficiency would be to specify one team member to do the electrical work while the other plans, collects tools and materials and provides them to the hands-on member. This could potentially reduce the amount of downtime and lead to quicker completion. Given that this is a learning exercise though, it's probably better to share duties so that each group member gets all the relevant experience.

### 4. Discuss the advantages of working inside in a shop as opposed to working on a typical jobsite. Give at least three advantages and disadvantages of each.

The shop class electrical wall was very easily accessible from the front and back. It was easy to keep tools and supplies nearby, either on the mock floor or on the nearby bench. Being surrounded by working electrical circuits helped to test work as it was done.
