# Plumbing Sink Install - Theory

## Johnny Bungay & Colin Kennedy

### 1. What are the two types of pipes involved in a plumbing system? Explain.

Pipes are generally classified as either pressure pipe or non-pressure pipe. Pressure pipe is used for water supply and distribution, and non-pressure pipe is used for drain, waste, and venting (DWV) installations.

### 2. Briefly describe the five types of plastic material used to make 90% of all plastic pipe.

- ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene)
 - Used primarily for drainage, waste, and vent piping.
 - Available in 1 1/4 to 12 inch diameter.
 - Two grades - service and DWV. Service required for to-code applications.
 - Black in color.
- PVC (Polyvinyl chloride)
 - Commonly used in pressure pipe applications, eg, water distribution, irrigation, and natural gas distribution. Also used for DWV applications.
 - 1 1/4 to 12 inch diameter.
 - White in color.
 - Rated for 100 psi at 73 degrees F.
 - Not suitable for hot water piping.
- CPVC (Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride)
 - Tan in color.
 - Rated for 100 psi at 180 degrees F.
 - Excellent chemical resistance.
 - Used for hot water and industrial applications.
- PE (Polyethylene)
 - Yellow in color - formerly orange.
 - Used most often to pipe natural gas.
- PEX (Cross linked Polyethylene)
 - Used for hot and cold water supply piping and radiant hot water heating.
 - Flexible. Less likely to be damaged by freezing than other plastics.
 - Must be protected from sunlight, oil, grease, and solvents.
 - Fitted with a special clamp rather than with adhesives.
- SR (Styrene-Rubber)
 - Used in septic tanks, drain fields, storm drains, and sewers.
 - Should not be used in a plumbing system.

### 3. What does the term outside diameter refer to in relation to plastic pipe? Why is it important?

Outside diameter refers to the diameter with respect to the outside edges of the pipe (as opposed to the inside diameter, which refers to the size of the 'hole' in the pipe). Outside diameter is important because it gives the size of the hole that must be drilled in order to pass the pipe through something.

### 4. Discuss the differences between copper pipe and Pex pipe. Include the advantages and disadvantages of each.

Copper and PEX are both suitable for hot and cold water supply applications.

Copper piping is rigid, while PEX is flexible. This means that installation of copper will require joins in situations where the PEX can simply bend - this means that the copper installation is more difficult, but can result in a 'cleaner' look, with straight lines and sharp angles.

Because PEX pipe is flexible, it is less likely than copper to burst in case of freezing.

One major advantage to copper is that it is safe to use in exposed areas, while PEX will degrade if exposed to sunlight.

### 5. Give a brief description of each of the following fittings and their uses:

- Reducer
 - For connecting a larger pipe to a smaller pipe. It 'reduces' the diameter.
- Elbow
 - For connecting two pipes at an angle.
- Sanitary Tee
 - A 'T'-join where the horizontal inlet is curved downward to facilitate flow and prevent blockage.
- Vent Tee
 - A 'T'-join used in a DWV application.
- P-Trap with Cleanout
 - A P-Trap with a valve on the bottom that can be opened in order to drain the trap.
- P-Trap with Slip Joint
 - A P-Trap where the inlet connection has a slip joint.
