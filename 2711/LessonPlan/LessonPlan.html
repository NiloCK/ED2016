  Text like this is used to communicate the intent and design goals of a

/* Question 1:
   Computer programs are made of functions. Sometimes a user
   calls a function, and sometimes functions call each other.

   To call a function in Javascript, use the function's name
   followed by parenthesis. Type callMeMaybe() into the white
   input bar on the lower right of the page and hit 'enter' to
   call this function and complete question one.

   (That input on the lower right is called a command line.)

        <p>The window on the left is a code editor, and it contains the instructions and problems for this assignment.</p>
        <p>As you work through the document and complete questions, make calls to <code>updateGrades()</code> in order to see how you're doing - the grades are on the right. (You'll learn how to make that call as you go).</p>
        <p>Computers are <strong>really</strong> picky about details, so look carefully when your code isn't behaving the way you think it should be. In particular, upper and lower case matter. <code>callmemaybe()</code> will not work if you mean to write <code>callMeMaybe()</code>.</p>
        <p>That said, it's often very difficult to spot mistakes in code. Don't hesitate to check with your teacher or another student when you find yourself stuck.</p>
