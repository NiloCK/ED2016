    <h1>Introduction to Blender</h1>
    <p>This screencast video introduces basic operations with the 3d modelling and animation program Blender, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Manipulating objects in the scene</li>
      <li>Adding and Deleting objects from the scene</li>
      <li>Joining, duplicating, and scaling objects</li>
      <li>Applying the smooth operation to objects</li>
      <li>Rendering an image, and the relationship between the camera, scene, and light sources</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pedagogical Concerns</h3>
    <p>This material relates to a number of specific curriculum outcomes from the <a href="http://www.ed.gov.nl.ca/edu/k12/curriculum/guides/teched/gr7/g7_comm-module_june2002.pdf">Grade 7 Communications Technology Module</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.07 - demonstrate understanding of how communications technologies are used to create, modify and disseminate information
      </li>
      <li>
        1.12 - demonstrate understanding of the purpose of technical drawings
      </li>
      <li>
        2.01 - use a range of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional representational techniques to communicate technical solutions and ideas
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Blender is is primarily used as an animation tool, but it is suitable for creating 3d mockups and design models. A 3d model can be the best tool to communicate the design and proportion of a complicated object.</p>
